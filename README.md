## (Offline) dense reconstruction: Visual SLAM + COLMAP

The pose graph generated by ORB-SLAM2 or VINS-Mono could be used for dense reconstruction, which has to be transfered into a specific format which can be read by COLMAP.

```
Part of code was extracted and modified from those open source project: 
    1. VINS-Mono (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono)
    2. ORB-SLAM2 (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)
    3. COLMAP (https://colmap.github.io/)
    4. MYNT-EYE-SDK, only left camera and IMU used 
    (https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-S-SDK)
    (https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-VINS-Sample)
    (https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-ORB-SLAM2-Sample)

The functionality in this project was built according to the requirement of COLMAP tutorial
"Reconstruct sparse/dense model from known camera poses", see:

## (Offline) dense reconstruction: Visual SLAM + COLMAP

The pose graph generated by ORB-SLAM2 or VINS-Mono could be used for dense reconstruction, which has to be transfered into a specific format which can be read by COLMAP.

Part of code was extracted and modified from those open source project: <br>
    1. VINS-Mono <br>
    (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) <br>
    2. ORB-SLAM2 <br>
    (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) <br>
    3. COLMAP <br>
    (https://colmap.github.io/) <br>
    4. MYNT-EYE-SDK (only left camera and IMU used) <br>
    (https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-S-SDK) <br>
    (https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-VINS-Sample) <br>
    (https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-ORB-SLAM2-Sample) <br>

The functionality in this project was built according to the requirement of COLMAP tutorial
"Reconstruct sparse/dense model from known camera poses", see:

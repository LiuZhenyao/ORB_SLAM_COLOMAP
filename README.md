# 1. PoseGraph Processing according to VINS-Mono and COLMAP

The fact is the pose graph generated by VINS could be used for dense reconstruction, which has to be transfered into a format can be used for COLMAP. <br>

For the keyframes generated by ORB-SLAM2, it has two formats according to KITTI and TUM dataset.

```
Part of code was extracted and modified from these open source project: 
    1. VINS-Mono
    2. COLMAP
    3. ORBSLAM2
    4. MYNT-EYE-SDK, only left camera and IMU used (Monocular Visual-inertial)

All the functions were built according to the requirement of COLMAP tutorial
"Reconstruct sparse/dense model from known camera poses", see:
